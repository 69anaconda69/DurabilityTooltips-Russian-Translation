### Features
- **Fully compatible:** Nothing required other than the Fabric API, but fully compatible with other mods like Mod Menu and Cloth Config.
- **Customisable:** Every colour, visibility, and part of the mod is customisable.
- **Lightweight:** Incredibly small footprint mod that isn't overly complicated.

Any issues with this for should be reported at/settled with **ME, and NOT with ddeeddii.**


This was originally a fork of [ddeeddii's Durability Plus](https://modrinth.com/mod/durability-plus) under the MIT license, iterating on it and making it more polished.

Due to fulfilling the *exact same function*, it's not recommended having both mods installed.
